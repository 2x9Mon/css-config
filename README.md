## CS:Source Config

### English Description

Yes, this is true. I decided upload my config in the game cs:source for everybody can use it.

My config hav 3 parts:

#### CFG FOLDER

Have the game properties in multiples files:

- autoexec.cfg: this file load immediately you run the game. He loads the others files.
- personal.cfg: Have my personal binds and settings about the game.
	
	My custom bind:
	```
	Bind "F1" "buy mp5navy ; buy vest ; buy hegrenade ; buy flashbang"
	Bind "F2" "buy m4a1 ; buy ak47 ; buy vest ; buy hegrenade ; buy flashbang"
	Bind "F3" "buy scout ; buy vest ; buy hegrenade ; buy flashbang ; buy deagle"
	Bind "F4" "Toggleconsole"
	bind "F5" "jpeg"
	Bind "F6" "buy awp ; buy vest ; buy hegrenade ; buy flashbang"
	bind "F7" "buy deagle"
	bind "F9" "rcon_password ghspain"
	bind "F10" "rcon exec server"
	bind "F11" "rcon mp_restartgame 1"
	bind "KP_MULTIPLY" "retry" (KP_MULTIPLY IS *)
	bind "MWHEELDOWN" "+jump"
	bind "MWHEELUP" "+jump"
	```
	I play in a 1280x1024 resolution whit all video settings in High/VeryHigh and @AAx4 @AFx8

	the autoexec dont load the fps config. If you need fps add in the autoexec this line:

	exec fpsconfig.cfg


- gamma.cfg: I bind the keys '+' and '-' of the numpad for increment and decrement the bright of the monitor.
- volume.cfg: binding of AvPag/RePag for increment and decrement the volume
- tick100.cfg: server tickrate config.
- launch options: The options that I use after launch the game (console, dxlevel, no-video,...)

Also I added 2 server config for you need load in your server for play a pracc (esl5on5eas and esl5on5eps)

#### GUI FOLDER
